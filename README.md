# How to work on github

## Windows

Preferably install [Git Bash](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest).

### Using Git Bash

Move to the desired folder/directory on your computer. Use the commands `ls` to see which files lie under the current folder/directory. Thereafter use `cd path_to_folder` to move into the desired folder. `cd` is "change directory". Once here, use `git clone https://github.com/GunGro/H21-TIO4120.git` to clone the repository from github into the current folder. Thereafter `cd` into the repository.
